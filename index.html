  Defintion of a Crisis?
</div>

<div class="section">
  A crisis is any event where you need some additional support to cope, whether you provide that support to yourself or need to seek it out from an external place. A crisis is any event or emotional state that is impacting your ability to meet any of the following four needs:
  <ol>
    <li>your physical human needs (e.g., eating, drinking, taking medication).</li>
    <li>Meet the physical and emotional needs of anyone in your care (e.g., walking dog).</li>
    <li>Self-care or care tasks (e.g., showering, brushing teeth, dishes, laundry).</li>
    <li>Meet your emotional needs (e.g., attending social events, keeping up with work and interests).</li>
  </ol>

  Not being able to meet any of these needs are what will be referred to as a "crisis." This word is used loosely, beacuse commonly, not being able to meet less vital needs can snowball into inability to meet more important needs, so any of these signs should be taken seriously. If you feel anything from apathety, to disrregulation, to overwhelm, to depression, this guide needs to be used. And it can be used at any other time to manage any elevated emotional state.

  What do I do now?
</div>
  


<div class="section">
For any type of crisis where safety is a concern, the <a href="./crisis.html">crisis plan</a> (indexed at the top) should be opened and followed. Safety concerns are not just immediate risks of harm-based behaviors, but also include passive behaviors like not eating or taking medication. Those are emergent signs that the safety plan needs to be opened. 
<br>
<br>
For cases where safety is not an immediate (or going to imminent emerge as an immediate risk), feelings of crisis still need to be addressed, to avoid escalation. For these situations, the <a href="./greenlight.html">greenlight page</a> is a list of vetted options of activities to help arrest the crisis, and move into a better emotional state. There are many options on this page, and it's okay to try a few different things before finding one that works!
